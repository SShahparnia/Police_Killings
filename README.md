# Police Killings Analysis 2015

A comprehensive machine learning analysis of police killings in the United States using demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic data to predict armed status and identify disparities.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **438 police killing incidents** from 2015 using advanced data science techniques to explore patterns in demographics, socioeconomic factors, and geographic distribution. We built and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict whether victims were armed based on various features.

## Key Findings

- **Model Performance**: Achieved up to **77% accuracy** using Logistic Regression in predicting armed status
- **Racial Disparities**: Identified significant differences in armed vs. unarmed incidents across racial groups
- **Socioeconomic Impact**: Lower income and higher poverty levels correlate with increased likelihood of armed incidents
- **Geographic Patterns**: Urban areas show higher concentration of incidents, with distinct regional clustering

## üî¨ Methodology

### Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression**: 77.17% accuracy, 68.05% F1-score
- **Random Forest**: 72.83% accuracy, 66.04% F1-score  
- **Support Vector Machine**: 77.17% accuracy, 67.22% F1-score

### Feature Engineering
- Processed **10 key features** including age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, poverty rate, unemployment rate, and education levels
- Created binary target variable `is_armed` (armed vs. unarmed)
- Applied StandardScaler normalization and label encoding for categorical variables

### Evaluation Techniques
- **5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation** for robust performance assessment
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis** for detailed classification evaluation
- **Feature Importance Analysis** using Random Forest and linear model coefficients

## Visualizations

The analysis includes **10+ interactive visualizations**:
- Geographic heatmaps using **Folium** showing incident distribution
- Correlation matrices revealing feature relationships
- Feature importance plots from Random Forest models
- Demographic distribution charts by armed status
- Socioeconomic scatter plots (poverty vs. income)
- Confusion matrices for all three models

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning models and evaluation
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Statistical visualizations
- **Folium** - Interactive geographic mapping
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development environment
